    Planning on working on the snake game. I will add a specific sequence that the player needs to create and represent
    the opposite using a DNA graphic along the bottom. As the player completes the sequence, the graphic will update.

    Done a total revamp of the snake game, now has a set sequence the player must complete and a much more intuitive way
    of representing it. The food is now generated with this sequence in mind, there is still random food choices for
    difficulty.

    Attempted to set up using pygbag again and the previous error has gone, however there still remains to be a blank,
    black screen.

    Next plans:
        - Add instructions and explain how it relates to the DNA concepts being taught
        - Add a score based on percentage of correct nucleotides

    Have decided to scrap the idea of having a website to host the games and tutorials, I cannot get pygbag to work, if
    I have free time at the end perhaps I can consider attempting to set it up again.
    Added sequence accuracy metric, next need to add the score to the csv file, also could calculate an overall score
    based on sequence length and accuracy
