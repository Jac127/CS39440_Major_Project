    Created a basic start to an RPG game which will eventually become my DNA version of paperboy. It features a character
    (a square that you can move with the arrow keys) and a scrolling background

24-04-24:
    Added basic background map in the paperboy like RPG

25-04-24:
    Added option to click through instructions
    Finished map for paperboy-like game

26-04-24:
    Added character
    Removed scrolling mechanic, overcomplicates code and game as the player cannot see where they are going
    For road paths I used a piece of code to draw the lines so that i could visualise where they are while adjusting the
    array containing the valid movement areas

    Just discovered that the snake game creates a sequence length of 25, the sequences generated should be of an even
    length

    Began development of procedural generation of character options based on DNA sequences, so far I have been using
    matplot lib as a way to edit images using code and have created a mask for both the bike and players clothes, now
    when trying to save the image and using it in the game the resolution is wrong, and it contains the axis.
    Using PIL instead but there seems to be a processing error. EASY FIX, just needed to set Image.fromArray(mode: 'RGBA'
    instead of 'RGB', there is an alpha value as the character has transparency

27-04-24:
    Passing segments of the dna sequence to a hash function then using hexdigest() to get a colour code. This colour
    code is being assigned to parts of the character

    The snake game now will produce a random sequence on game completion, when the image generation script is run, it
    now generates an image based on this, and when the paperboy game is ran, it automatically takes the image and uses
    it as the character.

    When displaying each character to the player in the character selection screen, the characters are very blurry. This
    is because PIL saves the image as 38x36, and in order for it to be an adequate size when displaying it to the
    player I need to scale it up.
    Added character selection functionality
